## Installation/Usage
1. Clone the repository, be sure to clone the SFML submodule recursively.
2. Run `cmake .` in the root of the repo to generate the makefile.
3. Run `make` to compile the project, this may take a while.
4. Run the `./main` executable
5. The command line will prompt the user to input the coordinates to control the chess pieces, first the coordinate of the chess piece that you want to move, then the final destination of that chess piece.

## Project Overview
- Written in C++
- Developed chess application. 
- Developed graphical and command line interfaces.
- User has the option to play against another user or computer.
- Documentation below provides a further insights to project design.

## User Input

Coordinate system used to determine piece locations, is aligned with the coordinate system used in chess. Positions are made up of two componenets row index, and column label.

$$ \text{Row index }, (R) = \[1,8\] $$

$$ \text{Column index }, (C) = \[A - H\] $$

$$ \text{Position }, (P) = (R,C) $$

### Command Line Interface

### Graphical User Interface


 - Front end: GUIâ€™s, User Experience
 - Back end: Data structure, Memory allocation
 - Input Options
    1. chess board coordinates:   WHITE:  (a-h), (1-8), BLACK (h-a), (8-1)
       Example of terminal input: White(player name): b8
    3. mouse click drag pieces to desired space.
 - Output Options
    1. Have a window that shows the actual gameplay

### Classes:
- Game (concrete):
  - Epic: User should be able to choose their moves and see game updates
  - User stories: 
    - Take user inputs
    - Output the pieces and boards
    - Record the historical moves
- Pieces (abstract):
  - Epic: User should be able to move each game piece
  - User stories:
    - Each piece has its own class that includes all commands and attributes
- Board (concrete):
  - Epic: User should have a clear depiction of the game board
  - User Stories:
   - Hold the unique location of each piece
- User Input:
  - Epic: Users should be able to control different aspects of the game with their keyboard
  - User stories:
    - As a user, I want to be able to choose which color I play as
    - As a user, I want to be able to control my chess pieces with my keyboard
   

- Objects (composite pattern):
  - Pawn (1)
  - Knight (4)
  - Bishop (4)
  - Queen (8)
  - King (10)

*Results will be updated throughout the game (based on piece values)

*(strategy pattern): implementing piece functionality

## Testing
- Our project was tested through executing the game and validated by comparing the expected GUI output with the actual GUI output.
- Since we are using a GUI, we have a test in the main function where we declared a number of chess pieces with a specific color and coordinates, and then we visually check that every pieces are in the correct position and color.
- For the user input, we inputted different coordinates and check whether the program outputs the expected result. If the coordinates or the move is not valid (such as not on the board) it will output "invalid output". If the coordinates and the move are both valid, then the chess pieces will update its position on the board.
